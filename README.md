Northern California CalTrain Schedule
=====================================

Display Northern California Caltrain schedule and real-time status.

I wrote this app for my personal use, and I only have tested it on Nexus 4,
so it might not work on your phone.

Require permissions:
1) Internet: to connect to caltrain web site.
2) Network state: to check if network is available.
3) Set alarm: to enable feature to add new alarm.
4) GPS location: to show map between two stations or to nearest station.

Require app(s):
1) Google map: to display map

Note: this app is utilized Caltrain real-time status by connecting to
Caltrain web site to obtain the data; at this moment, the data has yet been
available, so if you try to get real-time status, it would show nothing.

Thanks,
1) Caltrain gtfs information; I use these information to build the database for this app.
2) Caltrain real-time information: well it's unavailable yet but thanks anyway.
3) Google search: I wrote this app by googling a lot for Android and Java tutorials.
