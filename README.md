NorCalTrainTimetable
====================

Display Northern California Caltrain timetable and real-time status.

This project came about because my wife and I are car-pooling everyday to 
work and home, I drop her off early in the morning and pick her up in the 
afternoon at the San Jose downtown caltrain Diridon station. Most of the 
time, I don't have a good way to check if the train is late or early so 
I can plan accordingly.

As the result, I wrote this app and it will utilize caltrain real-time
web service to give me a update status on a certain route.
