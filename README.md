NorCalTrainTimetable
====================

Display Northern California Caltrain timetable and real-time status.

This project came about because my wife and I are car-pooling everyday to work and home, I drop her off early in the morning and pick her up in the afternoon in the San Jose downtown caltrain Diridon station. Most of the time, I don't have a good way to check if the train is late or early so I can plan accordingly.

In a later release, it would try to talk a to back-end web interface to get the latest up-to-date status on a certain route, and any emergency alert if provided.
